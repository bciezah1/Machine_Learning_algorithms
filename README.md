# Machine Learning Pipelines

This repository contains code scripts for implementing various machine learning pipelines. Each pipeline is organized in a Jupyter Notebook file, providing step-by-step code with explanations for model training, evaluation, and visualization. These scripts are designed to be versatile and applicable to a wide range of classification tasks. 

## Contents

- `knn_pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook contains a pipeline for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

- `logistic_regression.ipynb`: This notebook provides a pipeline for the Logistic Regression algorithm, including steps for data processing, model fitting, evaluation metrics, and model interpretation.

- `neural_network_pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook implements a basic neural network model for classification tasks. It includes data preparation, model architecture setup, training, and performance evaluation.

- `random_forest_pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook contains a Random Forest pipeline with steps for data preprocessing, model training, feature importance analysis, and evaluation metrics.

- `xgboost_pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook provides a pipeline for the XGBoost algorithm, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and performance metrics.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You may also need to install additional libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, and `tensorflow` for neural networks.

2. **Running the Notebooks**: Open each notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and follow the code cells step-by-step to understand the pipeline for each machine learning model.

3. **Dataset**: Replace the placeholder dataset paths in each notebook with your own data files. Ensure the data is formatted consistently with the requirements of each pipeline (e.g., feature scaling or encoding for categorical variables).

## Requirements

To install the necessary libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
